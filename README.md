## Requirements
- iOS 15.0+
- Xcode 14.0+
- Swift 5.0+

## Installation
1. Clone the repository.
2. Open `Universities.xcodeproj` in Xcode.

- View detailed information about each university.

## Swift Packages

This project is organized as a multi-module Swift package. It consists of the following modules:

- **UniversitiesList**: Contains the user interface and logic for browsing a list of universities.
- **UniversityDetails**: Contains the user interface and logic for viewing detailed information about a university.
- **DomainLayer**: Contains the business entities.
- **NetworkLayer**: A Swift package for handling network requests.
- **StorageLayer**: A Swift package for data persistence using Realm database.
- **DomainLayer**: A Swift package containing utility functions and extensions.

These modules are managed using Swift Package Manager and are included in the project.

## Architecture

The app follows the VIPER architecture:

- **View**: User interface components.
- **Interactor**: Business logic and networking.
- **Presenter**: Mediator between View and Interactor.
- **RemoteDataManager**: Handles remote data fetching and model objects.
- **LocalDataManager**: Handles local data storage and retrieval.
- **Wireframe**: Handles navigation between modules.
